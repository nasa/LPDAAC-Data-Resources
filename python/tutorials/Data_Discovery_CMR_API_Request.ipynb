    "# Data Discovery with NASA's CMR\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through how to search for Earthdata data collections and granules. Along the way we will explore the available search parameters, information return, and specific contrains when using the CMR API. Our object is to identify assets to access that we would downloaded, or perform S3 direct access, within an analysis workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand what CMR/CMR API is and what CMR/CMR API can be used for \n",
    "- How to use the `requests` package to search data collections and granules\n",
    "- How to parse the results of these searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is CMR\n",
    "CMR is the Common Metadata Repository.  It catalogs all data for NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).  It is the backend of [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search), the GUI search interface.  More information about CMR can be found [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/cmr).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the GUI for Earthdata Search is not accessible from a cloud instance - at least not without some work.  Earthdata Search is also not immediately reproducible.  What I mean by that is if you create a search using the GUI you would have to note the search criteria (date range, search area, collection name, etc), take a screenshot, copy the search url, or save the list of data granules returned by the search, in order to recreate the search.  This information would have to be re-entered each time you or someone else wanted to do the search.  You could make typos or other mistakes.  A cleaner, reproducible solution is to search CMR programmatically using the CMR API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the CMR API\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface.  It allows applications (software, services, etc) to send information to each other.  A helpful analogy is a waiter in a restaurant.  The waiter takes your drink or food order that you select from the menu, often translated into short-hand, to the bar or kitchen, and then returns (hopefully) with what you ordered when it is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMR API accepts search terms such as collection name, keywords, datetime range, and location, queries the CMR database and returns the results."

The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2\\xe2\\x80\\x933 days at 30-meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe HLSL30 product provides 30-m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived from Landsat 8/9 OLI data products.

The ASTER GDEM data products are created by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was created from the automated processing of the entire ASTER Level 1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) archive of scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. Stereo correlation was used to produce over one million individual scene based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking was applied. All cloud screened DEMs and non-cloud screened DEMs were stacked. Residual bad values and outliers were removed. In areas with limited data stacking, several existing reference DEMs were used to supplement ASTER data to correct for residual anomalies. Selected data were averaged to create final pixel values before partitioning the data into 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude tiles with a one pixel overlap. To correct elevation values of water body surfaces, the ASTER Global Water Bodies Database (ASTWBD) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTWBD.001) Version 1 data product was also generated. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe geographic coverage of the ASTER GDEM extends from 83\\xc2\\xb0 North to 83\\xc2\\xb0 South. Each tile is distributed in GeoTIFF format and projected on the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid. Each of the 22,912 tiles in the collection contain at least 0.01% land area. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nProvided in the ASTER GDEM product are layers for DEM and number of scenes (NUM).
